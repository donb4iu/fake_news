    "text": "When former President Donald Trump held a campaign event at Arlington National Cemetery last week, 1st Lt. Jimmy McCain says he viewed it as a \u201cviolation.\u201d\n\nThe youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain had already been moving away from the Republican Party \u2014 just weeks ago, he changed his voter registration to Democrat and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, he told CNN in an exclusive interview this week.\n\nBut he is speaking out now for the first time about Trump because of the former president\u2019s conduct at the hallowed ground where several generations of McCain\u2019s family, including his grandfather and great grandfather, are buried.\n\n\u201cIt just blows me away,\u201d McCain, who has served in the military for 17 years, told CNN. \u201cThese men and women that are laying in the ground there have no choice\u201d of whether to be a backdrop for a political campaign, he said.\n\n\u201cI just think that for anyone who\u2019s done a lot of time in their uniform, they just understand that inherently \u2014 that it\u2019s not about you there. It\u2019s about these people who gave the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country.\u201d\n\nMcCain\u2019s decision to speak out now is part of his broader shift away from the Republican Party and his family\u2019s famously conservative roots. After years as a registered independent, he says he registered as a Democrat several weeks ago and plans to vote for Kamala Harris in November, adding that he \u201cwould get involved in any way I could\u201d to help her campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s a significant move for the son of a former GOP presidential candidate and Arizona senator. While other members of the McCain family have distanced themselves from Trump \u2014 including Jimmy McCain\u2019s mother Cindy, who endorsed then-candidate Joe Biden in 2020, and his sister Meghan \u2014 none except Jimmy have publicly abandoned the Republican Party.\n\nDespite her harsh criticisms of Trump, Meghan McCain indicated last week that she would still not endorse Harris. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong, generational conservative,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nJimmy McCain, who enlisted in the Marine Corps at age 17 and now serves as an intelligence officer in the 158th Infantry Regiment, had until now deliberately sought to avoid entering the political fray. Trump\u2019s attacks on his father \u2014 that he was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d because he was captured in Vietnam, and his reported description of the elder McCain as a \u201closer\u201d \u2014 were deeply hurtful on a personal level, but not out of bounds politically, Jimmy McCain believes.\n\n\u201cOne thing about John McCain is that he chose a public life,\u201d McCain said. \u201cSo to attack him is really not out of the realm of his job description.\u201d\n\nFor the younger McCain, though, the Arlington episode and how the campaign has reacted to it represents a whole new level of what he perceives as Trump\u2019s disrespect for the fallen. And he believes it stems from Trump\u2019s own insecurities about not having served.\n\n\u201cMany of these men and women, who served their country, chose to do something greater than themselves,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThey woke up one morning, they signed on the dotted line, they put their right hand up, and they chose to serve their country. And that\u2019s an experience that Donald Trump has not had. And I think that might be something that he thinks about a lot.\u201d\n\nMcCain emphasized that he is speaking on his own behalf and his views do not represent those of the US Army. McCain received his commission and became an officer in US Army intelligence in 2022.\n\nMcCain\u2019s anger over the Arlington episode was also particularly acute because when it happened, he had just returned from a seven-month deployment to a small US base on the Jordan-Syria border known as Tower 22.\n\nHe arrived there just weeks after three US service members were killed on the base in a drone attack by Iran-backed militants, and he says he thought of them when he saw Trump posing last Monday in front of gravestones.\n\n\u201cIt was a violation,\u201d McCain said. \u201cThat mother, that sister, those families, see that \u2014 and it\u2019s a painful experience.\u201d\n\nTrump visited the cemetery last Monday following a wreath laying ceremony honoring the 13 US military service members who were killed at Kabul airport\u2019s Abbey Gate in Afghanistan in 2021. His campaign filmed the visit, leading to an altercation with a cemetery staffer who attempted to prevent Trump\u2019s team from photographing and filming in the area where recent US casualties are buried. According to the Army, doing so violates federal law, Army regulations and Defense Department policies.\n\nTrump is not the first politician to violate a ban on political activity at Arlington. In fact, more than 20 years ago, John McCain said he made \u201ca very bad mistake\u201d when he released a campaign ad that featured a clip of him walking through the cemetery.\n\nTrump and his campaign, however, have not issued such a mea culpa. Instead, according to the US Army, they ignored and \u201cabruptly pushed aside\u201d a cemetery staffer who protested the activity and published footage of the event later anyway. One of Trump\u2019s campaign managers, Chris LaCivita, called the Army \u201chacks\u201d and said it was \u201c100% a manufactured story.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Trump\u2019s campaign released taped statements from family members of some of the service members who were killed at Abbey Gate, who said they invited Trump to their loved ones\u2019 graves. But the campaign\u2019s video of the event, which they put on TikTok, showed other gravestones, too \u2014 including that of an Army Special Forces soldier who died by suicide, and whose family said they did not give the campaign permission to film it.\n\nMcCain, for his part, is now bracing to get more involved in this election cycle. While he has been involved in veteran advocacy work for years, he acknowledges that his own recent political shift has been deeply personal.'}\n\n\u201cJohn McCain was my father, and a lot of people lose that in the minutia,\u201d McCain said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t \u2018John McCain\u2019 the way he is to the world. He was the man who loved me. And the one thing I\u2019ve known about my dad since the moment I could think, was that he was a good man and that he had done his part. And for me to be with him towards the end of his life, hearing things [from Trump] like, he was a loser because he was captured\u2014I don\u2019t think I could ever overlook that.\n"
